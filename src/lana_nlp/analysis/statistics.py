"""
Analyze song lyrics and compute descriptive statistics.

This module contains the LyricsAnalyzer class, which provides methods
for exploring a collection of song lyrics. It calculates song and album
statistics, search lyrics, measures vocabulary usage, and computes
basic NLP metrics such as lexical diversity and word frequency.

The analyzer operates on a pandas DataFrame containing song metadata
and lyrics, and creates derived metrics such as word count and
estimated reading time for each song.
